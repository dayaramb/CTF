## Write-up

A safe rule to follow when attempting CTF web challenges is **unless the flag is visible on the website, begin by viewing the source behind the page.** To do so, right click and select the view page source option. Great! Doing so, you can see:

```
<!-- Cool! Look at me! This is an HTML file. It describes what each page contains in a format your browser can understand. -->
<!-- The first part of the flag (there are 3 parts) is 9daca0510ff -->
<!-- What other types of files are there in a webpage? -->
```

Copy the first part of the flag (`9daca0510ff`) into the flag submission box (don't submit yet) and look back at the comments in the HTML source. The last line seems to point you towards the next (2) parts of the flag. A quick Google search will list other file types in webpages as `js`, `css`, `jpg`. Looking at the same source as before, you can see all three of those forms. `js` (JavaScript) and `css` (Cascading Style Sheets) are all readable text so parsing won't be that hard. Opening the links the `hacker.css` and `script.js` (underlined and in blue) lets you view the files in a new tab. The stylesheets file contains the second part: `eb6c5680635` and the JavaScript file contains the third and final part: `f1ef52d049f`. Pasting these two parts after the first one into the flag submission box should earn you 20 points.
