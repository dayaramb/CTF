**Description:**

> Given the relative success of the first release, it was no surprise that a second installment in the TW:GR series was released. I can't beat this one either, though... those darn spatulas put an induction cooktop in the floor so I can't get to the flag! Can you get it for me? You can play the game here.

> Toasters can't go through induction cooktops because they're made of metal. However, it looks like there's a nice, friendly spatula on the last floor; and better yet, he's made of rubber! I'm sure he could be persuaded to go pick up the flag and bring it back to you.
