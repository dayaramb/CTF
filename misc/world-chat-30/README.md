Go see if you can find the messenger at shell2017.picoctf.com:14747. Remember to use Ctrl-C to cut the connection if it overwhelms you!

> There are cool command line tools that can filter out lines with specific keywords in them. Check out 'grep'! You can use the '|' character to put all the output into another process or command (like the grep process)
